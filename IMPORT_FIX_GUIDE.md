# Import Path Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
The white screen issue was caused by incorrect import paths using the alias `@/` instead of relative paths. The following files have been updated:

### Files Fixed:
1. **App.jsx** - Fixed BasicToaster import path
2. **MainPage.jsx** - Fixed all component and service imports
3. **ChatPage.jsx** - Fixed all UI component and service imports
4. **PatientForm.jsx** - Fixed all UI component and hook imports
5. **PredictionResult.jsx** - Fixed UI component imports
6. **toast-simple.jsx** - Fixed utils import path

## Testing Steps:

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd "d:\College\Konecta\GP\Covid-19-Classification"
python main.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend Server
```bash
cd "d:\College\Konecta\GP\Covid-19-Classification\frontend_vite"
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Both Pages:

#### Risk Assessment Page:
- Should load without white screen
- Form should be visible and functional
- Submit should show prediction results in new format:
  - Yes/No prediction
  - Risk level badge (High/Moderate/Low)
  - 5-line medical analysis

#### Medical Assistant Page:
- Click "Medical Assistant" in navigation
- Should load chat interface without white screen
- Should be able to send messages about COVID-19
- Should receive RAG-powered responses

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ No more white screens
- ✅ Both pages load properly
- ✅ Navigation works between pages
- ✅ Prediction shows new format (Yes/No + risk + analysis)
- ✅ Chat interface functional with RAG responses

## If Still Issues:
1. Check browser console for any remaining import errors
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Restart both servers

The root cause was the alias `@/` not resolving correctly, so all imports were converted to relative paths (./components/, ../services/, etc.).
